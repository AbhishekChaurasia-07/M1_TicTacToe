#  __INTRODUCTION__

Tic-Tac-Toe (or Noughts and crosses, Xs and Os) is a pencil-and-paper game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.Players soon discover that best play from both parties leads to a draw (often referred to as cat or cat's game). Hence, Tic-tac-toe is most often played by young children.The friendliness of Tic-tac-toe games makes them ideal as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. It is straightforward to write a computer program to play Tic-tac-toe perfectly, to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the state space complexity), or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space.

# __HISTORY__

An early variant of Tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called Terni Lapilli and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. However, according to Claudia Zaslavsky's book Tic Tac Toe: And Other Three-In-A Row Games from Ancient Egypt to the Modern Computer, Tic-tac-toe could originate back to ancient Egypt. Another closely related ancient game is Three Men's Morris which is also played on a simple grid and requires three pieces in a row to finish.

* The different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to "Noughts and crosses", the British name, appeared in 1864. The first print reference to a game called "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884, but referred to "a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored". "Tic-tac-toe" may also derive from "tick-tack", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The U.S. renaming of Noughts and crosses as Tic-tac-toe occurred in the 20th century.

* In 1952, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses) for the EDSAC computer became one of the first known video games. The computer player could play perfect games of Tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.

* In 1975, Tic-tac-toe was also used by MIT students to demonstrate the computational power of Tinkertoy elements. The Tinkertoy computer, made out of (almost) only Tinkertoys, is able to play Tic-tac-toe perfectly. It is currently on display at the Museum of Science, Boston.

# __VARIATIONS OF TIC TAC TOE__

* In Misère tic-tac-toe the player wins if the opponent gets n in a row. A 3? game is a draw. Tic Tac Tactic: A new game played on a three-dimensional board. Each player takes it in turns to send their ball at least half way round the curved board until it drops down into one of the 9 indents of the 3 x 3 grid. The player wins balls by forming a row of 3, and they can, using a rubber device, change the outcome of their ball's path and bounce their ball to where they want. Each 3-in-a-row wins a ball of the player. The winner is skilful enough to have won five balls off his opponent

* In Nine board tic-tac-toe, nine Tic-tac-toe boards are themselves arranged in a 3? grid. The first player's move may go on any board; all moves afterwards are placed in the empty spaces on the board corresponding to the square of the previous move (that is, if a move were in the upper-left square of a board, the next move would take place on the upper-left board). If a player cannot move because the indicated board is full, the next move may go on any board. Victory is attained by getting 3 in a row on any board. This makes the game considerably longer and more involved than Tic-tac-toe, with a definite opening, middle game and endgame. ->Super tic-tac-toe is played like Nine board tic-tac-toe except that the game does not end when a player wins a game on one of the small boards. Instead, the position of the small board where that player won is marked on a 3? grid, and a player wins when they form 3-in-a-row on that grid

* In Tic-Tac-Chess, players play a game of chess and Tic-tac-toe simultaneously. When a player captures an opponent's piece, the player can make a play on the Tic-tac-toe board regardless if the other player has not yet made a play. The first person to get 3 Xs or Os in a row wins the game. This makes for a much more defensive game of chess.

# __HOW TO PLAY__

* Choose your opponent

* Press a square to place your mark

* Make three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win

* Watch your opponent and block them if they get 2 in a row

* Try a harder mode to keep it interesting

* Turn off sounds using the top right menu

* Use the top left menu to reset your scores for the current opponent

# __ABOUT TIC TAC TOE__
## RULES

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and fun game for 2 players, X and O. It is played on a 3x3 grid. Each player's goal is to make 3 in a row.Typically, X starts first, but in Gametable's Tabletop Tic Tac Toe, Player 1 starts first on the first game and Player 2 (or the computer) starts first on the next game. The starting player continues to alternate from game to game. This helps keep gameplay fair over time. Players take turns placing their Mark, X or O, on an open square in the grid. The first player to make 3 of their own mark in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.If all 9 squares are filled and neither player has 3 in a row, the game is considered a Tie.The expert artificial intelligence (AI) will play a perfect game. Try your best to Tie it for as long as you can!

## ZERO-SUM GAME

Tic-Tac-Toe is a zero-sum game, which means that if both players are playing their best, the game will end in a Tie. However, if you learn how to play tic-tac-toe and master some simple strategies, then you'll be able to not only play, but to win the majority of the time.

## NOUGHTS AND CROSSES

Tic Tac Toe is known by a few other names around the world. The most common of these is "Noughts and Crosses" and it is sometimes simply referred to as the "XO game."

# TIC-TAC-TOE GAME DESIGN

When a player makes a move, we need to check if he/she wins the game. A simple solution is to check O(N^2) grid for horizontal, vertical and two diagonals to see if they are all occupied by this player. However, a better solution that has O(1) time would be to trade space for time. That is, we use O(N) space to record the number of each players in each row, column and two diagonals.
Instead of storing the counters for each player, We can alternatively reduce the space usage to half i.e. increment the counter for player 1 and decrement the counter for player 2. Then we need to check if the absolute value of the counter equals to N.

# Tic-Tac-Toe Frame

The TicTacToeFrame (shown in figure 4.2.2) has a menu bar, the BoardPanel, and can open the three dialogs. The final static String values contain the file locations of the help and about HTML files respectively. This class extends java.swing.JFrame.

The constructor instantiates all of the components, their listeners, and the dialogs. It also, resizes, and centers the frame but it does not make it visible yet. The initMenuBar method is called by the constructor to build the menu bar.

The getBoard method returns the board variable. The update repaints and performs any necessary update functions to make sure the view represents the current GameState. The openNewGameDialog, openHelpDialog, and openAboutDialog methods open the respective dialogs. The announceEnd announces the end of a game and displays Player p as the winner; if p is null, then this method announces a tie. The askPlayAgain method prompts the user to play again and returns their choice (true for yes).

# The Game theory

The game of Noughts and Crosses or Tic Tac Toe is well known throughout the world and variants are thought to have been played over 2000 years ago in Rome. It’s a very simple game – the first person to get 3 in a row wins. In fact it’s so simple that it has been “solved” – before any move has been played we already know it should result in a draw (as long as the participants play optimal moves).The way to solve Noughts and Crosses is to use combinatorial Game Theory – which is a branch of mathematics that allows us to analyses all different outcomes of an event.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101011183/160985960-270b9c47-6ca8-4d89-ae74-6e2093329add.png)

This is the start of the game tree for Noughts and Crosses. We can expand this game tree to cover every possible outcome for the game. Once this complete tree is drawn, any participant can work through this tree to see what is their optimal move at any one time from any position.An upper bound for the number of positions and number of different games is given by:3 9= 19,683. This is the total number of possible game positions in a 3×3 grid – as every square will either be a O, X or blank.9! = 362,880. This is the total number of ways that positions can be filled on the grid. (First you have 9 choices of squares, then there are 8 choices of squares etc). This counts each X and O as distinct from other X and Os.9 choose 5 = 126. This is the number of different combinations of filling the grid with 5 Xs and 4 Os.However the analysis of this game tree can be significantly simplified by realising that many different positions are simply reflections or rotations of each other. By looking only for distinct positions (positions that are isometric under refection and rotation) we can, for example, see that there are actually only three distinct starting moves – as shown in the diagram above.
